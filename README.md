# Frontend Mentor Challenges

My challenges from [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io)

## How to use

This repository uses a Webpack configuration to generate a simple webserver with reloading.

In order to use it correctly, you should point an `app` environment variable to the challenge folder and then call `npm run serve`.
